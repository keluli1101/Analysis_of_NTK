Analysis of the Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization
This analysis provide an in-depth understanding of the neural tangent kernel(NTK), including its properties, limitations,
and future research directions. Additionally, the study introduces a concept known as "lazy training"; which refers to a
phenomenon that occurs when training a over-parameterized neural network. In such instances, the training loss tends to
converge rapidly to zero but the corresponding network parameters hardly change. NTK provides an explanation for the
reasons behind this phenomenon.
